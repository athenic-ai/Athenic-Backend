# Agent Orchestration Layer

## Overview

The Agent Orchestration Layer is a core component of Operation Agentic, designed to transform Athenic into a more autonomous, powerful, and intelligent agentic system. This layer enables complex task execution through a coordinated multi-agent architecture.

## Architecture

The system follows a hierarchical multi-agent architecture with specialized agents that collaborate to solve complex problems:

### Components

1. **Executive Agent**
   - Central coordinator that interprets user instructions
   - Makes high-level decisions about task prioritization
   - Synthesizes results for user presentation
   - Handles signals and decides on actions

2. **Knowledge Agent**
   - Responsible for information retrieval
   - Manages contextual understanding
   - Analyzes objects to generate cognitive insights
   - Synthesizes information from multiple sources

3. **Planner Agent**
   - Breaks down complex tasks into specific subtasks
   - Creates structured execution plans with dependencies
   - Optimizes resource allocation across subtasks
   - Generates contingency plans for potential failures

4. **Executor Agent**
   - Interfaces directly with tools and external systems
   - Manages execution of planned steps
   - Monitors execution and provides real-time feedback
   - Handles error recovery during execution

5. **Memory Manager**
   - Maintains short-term working memory for immediate task context
   - Stores long-term memory for persistent knowledge
   - Provides semantic search capabilities for relevant information
   - Records execution history for future reference

6. **Tools Manager**
   - Manages registration and execution of tools
   - Provides standardized interfaces for tool integration
   - Validates parameters and handles tool execution results
   - Categorizes tools for easier discovery and selection

## Workflow

The typical workflow through the Agent Orchestration Layer:

1. User request is received by the AgentOrchestrator
2. Executive Agent interprets the request into a structured task
3. Knowledge Agent gathers relevant information
4. Planner Agent creates a detailed execution plan
5. Executor Agent implements the plan using appropriate tools
6. Executive Agent synthesizes results for presentation to the user

For autonomous operation, the system also supports an agentic loop where it can process jobs continuously without user intervention.

## Integration with Athenic

The Agent Orchestration Layer integrates with the existing Athenic system by:

- Using Athenic's flexible object-based database structure
- Defining agent memories and executions as specialized object types
- Enhancing the existing Signal system with more sophisticated cognitive analysis
- Supporting hierarchical jobs for complex multi-step tasks
- Providing both lightweight and heavyweight processing pathways
- Enabling autonomous operation through continuous monitoring and action

### Database Integration

Instead of creating new tables, the Agent Orchestration Layer leverages Athenic's existing flexible object-based database structure:

- **Working Memory**: Stored as `agent_working_memory` object type for short-term, temporary storage
- **Long-term Memory**: Stored as `agent_long_term_memory` object type with vector embeddings for semantic search
- **Execution History**: Stored as `agent_execution` object type to track execution steps and results

This approach maintains database flexibility while allowing the agent system to store and retrieve its data efficiently.

## Next Steps

- Implement the E2B Sandbox environment for secure execution
- Develop concrete tool implementations for web browsing, file operations, etc.
- Create database schemas for agent memory storage
- Build integration points with the frontend for real-time feedback
- Enhance the Signal system with the new cognitive framework

## Implemented Components

### E2B Sandbox Environment

The E2B Sandbox Environment has been implemented to provide a secure execution environment for agent operations. It leverages E2B's MicroVMs to run code in an isolated environment with controlled access to resources.

Key features:
- Secure execution of shell commands with configurable allowlists
- Browser automation for web interactions
- File system operations for data persistence
- Firewall rules to control network access
- Resource limits to prevent abuse
- Comprehensive logging for audit purposes

Usage example:

```typescript
// Create a sandbox with appropriate security policies
const sandbox = new SandboxEnvironment(
  supabaseClient,
  organizationId,
  {
    allowedHosts: ['api.example.com'],
    allowedCommands: ['node', 'npm', 'curl'],
    resourceLimits: {
      cpuLimit: 2,
      memoryMB: 2048,
      timeoutSec: 300
    }
  }
);

// Initialize the sandbox
await sandbox.initialize();

// Execute commands
const result = await sandbox.executeCommand('curl https://api.example.com/data');

// Clean up when done
await sandbox.cleanup();
```

The Sandbox Environment is integrated with the ExecutorAgent to enable secure execution of tools and commands as part of agent tasks.
